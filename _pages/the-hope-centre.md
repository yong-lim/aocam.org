    <p>The overarching mission of Asian Outreach Cambodia is to restore hope and dignity to rural Cambodians by breaking the poverty cycle and we believe that The Hope Centre (THC) will act as tool today in helping achieve this goal and have in impact in North Eastern Cambodia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2018 saw The Hope Centre  playing a significant role as a base for equipping and empowering those living in the rural communities in Stung Treng with pertinent vocational skills, while at the same time facilitating opportunities for NGOs to meet and work together in the surrounding communities. Through our programs we have prepared locals to be employable for the economic development and growth anticipated in the near future and improve the capacity of those working in professional fields. The service will also serve those in the five surrounding provinces of Stung Treng.  We have focused specifically on English, computers and teacher training. Additionally for 2018 we conducted mant leadership development programs equipping future leaders in a range of skills.</p>
