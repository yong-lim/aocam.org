We recently celebrated International Children's Day at Asian Outreach Cambodia with the students in our Assisting Children to School (ACTS) project. The aim was an enjoyable afternoon that honoured God's children and shared His love with them. Upon arriving in the village we were greeted by hundreds of smiling faces. The children were eager to get involved. We prayed together, sung to worship music and played games together. A short informative video about Child Safety and protection was shown informing the students how to keep themselves safe, followed by a discussion to ensure they understood the message. Lunch was provided, and at the end of the day each child received a gift of a new pair of shoes. The children are already excited about next year's Childrenâ€™s Day!

Later this year we will be celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Asian Outreach Cambodia. There will be various events happening and resources available for you to help celebrate with us all that has been achieved since 1993. Look out for more details shortly!

This week we hosted a gathering of eight different organisations and churches doing ministry in Stung Treng Province. We met together in the AOC Boardroom to share about our activities and prayer needs. It was a great morning and encouraging to be able to see many different people come together.
