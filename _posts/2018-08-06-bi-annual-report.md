## What's been happening?
{: .title .is-4 .aocam-blue}

Last week at The Hope Centre there was a buzz in the air, as Hair Aid, Australia, came with a team of professional hairdressers to offer training to 63 students from eleven villages. It was so exciting to finally be able to offer vocational training to passionate local youth - something which has been a dream in the making. The students learnt a variety of hair styles and on graduation day were gifted with starter packs which had high quality scissors, capes, clips etc to go and start their own small business. Some of the students plan to use their new skills to go out and do ministry with their local church, as a community outreach program. 

It truly was exciting to see The Hope Centre buzzing with the trainers, the models for getting hair cuts, the AOC staff running around translating, cooking and cleaning. During the lunch breaks some were reading books in the Library, playing the guitars and table tennis together. It was so encouraging to stand back and see so much life and community around. 

We want to say a big thank you to Hair Aid for coming and partnering with us and we're really excited for their return early next year.

A REMARKABLE JOURNEY!
{: .title .is-4 .aocam-blue}

2018 represents a landmark in the journey of Asian Outreach Cambodia. This
year we celebrate 25 years of pioneering and partnership among the most needy and vulnerable in Cambodia.

Our passion, our vision has been to help restore hope and dignity to Cambodians by breaking the poverty cycle in rural communities. Working with local leaders and international partners, AOC has been working holistically to see lasting change happen. We believe that for sustainable transformation to happen it needs to be at least four dimensional - physical, spiritual, economic, educational.

Over the past 25 years AOC has worked in 3 provinces among 31 rural
communities. During that time, as some examples, we have:

- Treated over 200,000 people through our health clinics and medical programs
- Provided 15,000 people with emergency food rations
- Educated 26,000 children through health education and assisting children
to school work
- Partnered with many hundreds of local leaders and church groups to help
restore value, dignity and hope to communities.
- Resourced over 125,000 people with clean water and latrines.
- Received 3 gold medals for outstanding service to Cambodia

As we look towards the next decade, we see there is a desperate need for
positive Khmer role models of leadership. Khmer leaders who have a genuine
heart and integrity to help their people. Those who love God and are called to
serve Him and His people in every sector of their society. As we look to the
future, we are committed to not only building good projects, but also building
great leaders. Over the next year alone, our plan is to see over 300 people trained in Stung Treng province.

Itâ€™s time to celebrate, dream and invest! We are so grateful for your ongoing
partnership together as we continue on this exciting journey.
